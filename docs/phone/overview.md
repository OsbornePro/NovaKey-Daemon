# Phone App Overview (iOS)

NovaKey (iOS) is the “vault and control surface”:

- Secrets are stored **only on your phone** (iOS Keychain).
- Sending/copying requires **Face ID / passcode**.
- Secrets are never shown again after you tap **Save**.

## Main concepts

### Secrets
A secret is a labeled value you can copy locally or send to a paired computer.

### Listeners
A Listener is a saved “computer target” (name, host/IP, port). One Listener can be marked as the **Send Target**.

### Pairing
Pairing establishes mutual trust between the iOS app and NovaKey-Daemon. You typically do this once per computer/device.
