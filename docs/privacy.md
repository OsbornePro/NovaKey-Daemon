## Data Stored Locally on Your Device

### Secrets
Secrets you add to NovaKey:

## Clipboard Handling

### Phone Clipboard
When you copy a secret:
- The secret is placed on the local iOS clipboard
- Clipboard use requires explicit user action
- Clipboard contents may auto-clear after a configurable timeout
- Clipboard may be cleared when the app moves to the background (if enabled)

### Computer Clipboard (NovaKey-Daemon)
On supported systems, NovaKey-Daemon may inject a secret into the computer’s clipboard as part of delivery.

NovaKey does not monitor, read, or transmit clipboard contents beyond the requested operation.

## Network Communication

NovaKey communicates only with:
- Computers you explicitly pair
- Over encrypted, authenticated connections

NovaKey does not communicate with analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Accessibility and Input Permissions

On some platforms, NovaKey-Daemon may request:
- Accessibility permissions
- Input Monitoring permissions

These permissions are required only to perform explicit actions you request (such as securely injecting secrets). NovaKey does not monitor general user activity or keystrokes.

---

## Data Deletion

You can delete your data at any time by:
- Removing secrets within the app
- Removing paired listeners
- Uninstalling the app

Uninstalling NovaKey removes all locally stored data.
