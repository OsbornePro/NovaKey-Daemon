# NovaKey Documentation

NovaKey has two parts:

- **NovaKey (iOS app)** — stores secrets in the iOS Keychain and sends them to a paired computer.
- **NovaKey-Daemon** — runs on your computer, receives encrypted messages, and either types the secret or copies it to the clipboard (depending on OS/policy).

- [Troubleshooting](phone/troubleshooting.md)
