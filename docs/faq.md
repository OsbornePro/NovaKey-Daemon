# Security FAQ

## How are secrets protected?
Secrets are stored securely on your phone using the iOS Keychain or Android KeyStore and can only be sent after Face ID or passcode authentication.

## Are secrets encrypted?
Yes. Communication between your phone and computer is encrypted and authenticated after pairing.

## What is pairing?
Pairing securely connects your phone and computer so they can recognize and trust each other. You only need to pair once per computer.

## Can someone else send secrets to my computer?
No. Only devices you explicitly pair are allowed to send secrets.

## Can NovaKey protect against malware?
NovaKey is designed to reduce risk when typing secrets, but it cannot protect against a fully compromised operating system. Only pair with computers you trust.

## What is Two-Man Mode?
Two-Man Mode requires approval on the computer before a secret is injected. This helps prevent accidental or unauthorized sending.

# Everyday Questions (Non-Technical)

## Why can’t I see secrets after saving them?
NovaKey avoids showing secrets on screen after they are saved. This reduces the chance of screen recording or shoulder surfing. You can still copy or send secrets after authentication.

## Why does it say “Copied to clipboard on computer”?
NovaKey tried to type the secret but was blocked by system rules. Instead, it safely copied the secret to the computer’s clipboard and told you clearly.

## Why can’t I edit the computer address after pairing?
Pairing is tied to a specific computer address for safety. If the address changes, you’ll need to add a new listener and pair again.

## Do my phone and computer need to be on the same Wi-Fi?
Yes, if you’re sending secrets directly from your phone to your computer. They must be on the same local network.

## Is NovaKey tracking me?
No. NovaKey does not use analytics, tracking, or user accounts.

## Who is NovaKey for?
NovaKey is for anyone who wants a safer way to use passwords without typing them, especially in shared spaces or on untrusted keyboards.
