# Glossary

**Listener**
A saved computer target in the NovaKey app. A Listener represents a paired computer running NovaKey-Daemon and includes its host or IP address, port, and a friendly name.

**Secret**
Sensitive data stored securely in the NovaKey app, such as a password or token.

**Pairing**
The one-time process that securely connects your phone and computer. Pairing establishes mutual trust and enables encrypted, authenticated communication between the devices.

**Pro Unlock**
A one-time purchase that removes Free-tier limits in the NovaKey app.

**Send Target**
The Listener selected as the default destination when sending secrets.

**Arming**
A temporary safety gate on the computer that allows secrets to be received for a short time window. If the computer is not armed, injection is blocked.

**Two-Man Mode**
A security option that requires an explicit approval on the computer before a secret can be injected, within a short time window.

**Injection**
Typing the secret directly into the currently focused text field on the computer.

**Clipboard Mode**
A fallback delivery method where the daemon copies the secret to the computer’s clipboard instead of typing it, and reports this clearly to the user.
